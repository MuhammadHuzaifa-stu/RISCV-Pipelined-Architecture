# Pipelined RISCV Processor implementation!

* In this repository, you will find a pipelined implementation of a RISCV processor, which includes three stages: Fetch, Decode + Execute, and Memory + Writeback. The code has been updated to include support for all RISCV instructions.

* To run the processor, please consult the provided {code.s} file, which contains the code for calculating the factorial of a number (in this case 5!). The implementation includes support for all RISCV instructions, allowing for a wide range of programs to be executed on the processor.

* Please note that while the pipelined architecture offers improved performance over the single cycle implementation, it may also introduce additional complexity and potential hazards, such as data hazards and control hazards. It is recommended to carefully test and debug your programs to ensure correct operation of the processor.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to open an issue or reach out to the repository owner for assistance.
